<h1>My Java Learning/Beginner Projects</h1>

Welcome to the showcase of my school learning journey in object-oriented Java programming! In this repository, I have compiled a collection of beginner-level projects that demonstrate my understanding of fundamental Java concepts and object-oriented principles. These projects were completed as part of my coursework during my time at The University of North Texas.

<h2> Java Skills Demonstrated: </h2>

- Use of ArrayList: The program creates an ArrayList called cars to store a list of vehicles. It demonstrates how to create an ArrayList, add elements to it, access elements using the index, and modify elements.

- Looping: The program uses a for loop to iterate over the ArrayList and print each car. It initializes a loop variable (i) to iterate from 0 to the size of the ArrayList, and then accesses each element using the get() method.

- ArrayList methods: The program uses various ArrayList methods, such as add(), indexOf(), and set(). These methods allow adding elements to the ArrayList, finding the index of an element, and replacing an element at a specific index, respectively.

- Printing output: The program uses System.out.println() to print the report title and the cars in the ArrayList. It demonstrates the basic usage of printing output to the console.

- Enhanced for loop: The program also uses an enhanced for loop (for-each loop) to iterate over the ArrayList and print each car. This type of loop simplifies iterating over collections, such as ArrayLists, by automatically handling the index and providing direct access to each element.
