<h2> Overview </h2>

As a college student, I developed a vehicle tracking application in Java that effectively showcases my skills in key Java concepts and techniques. In this project, I utilized the following Java skills to implement the functionality:

First and foremost, I employed the ArrayList class from the Java Collections framework. By leveraging the dynamic resizing and built-in methods of ArrayList, I efficiently managed a list of vehicles, enabling the addition, insertion, and replacement of elements.

To iterate over the list, I employed both a traditional for loop and an enhanced for loop. The traditional loop allowed me to access elements using their index, while the enhanced loop simplified the iteration process, making the code more readable and concise.

String manipulation played a crucial role in this project. I skillfully used various String methods to add, insert, and replace vehicle names within the ArrayList. By leveraging functions like indexOf() and set(), I could easily find the index of specific vehicles and modify the elements accordingly.

I also ensured the proper display of information by using the System.out.println() statement. By employing this standard output method, I effectively printed report titles and the contents of the ArrayList, ensuring clear and informative output for users.
