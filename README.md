<h1>My Java Learning/Beginner Projects</h1>

Welcome to the showcase of my school learning journey in object-oriented Java programming! In this repository, I have compiled a collection of beginner-level projects that demonstrate my understanding of fundamental Java concepts and object-oriented principles. These projects were completed as part of my coursework during my time at The University of North Texas.
<h2> Overview </h2>

As a college student, I developed a vehicle tracking application in Java that effectively showcases my skills in key Java concepts and techniques. In this project, I utilized the following Java skills to implement the functionality:

First and foremost, I employed the ArrayList class from the Java Collections framework. By leveraging the dynamic resizing and built-in methods of ArrayList, I efficiently managed a list of vehicles, enabling the addition, insertion, and replacement of elements.

To iterate over the list, I employed both a traditional for loop and an enhanced for loop. The traditional loop allowed me to access elements using their index, while the enhanced loop simplified the iteration process, making the code more readable and concise.

String manipulation played a crucial role in this project. I skillfully used various String methods to add, insert, and replace vehicle names within the ArrayList. By leveraging functions like indexOf() and set(), I could easily find the index of specific vehicles and modify the elements accordingly.

I also ensured the proper display of information by using the System.out.println() statement. By employing this standard output method, I effectively printed report titles and the contents of the ArrayList, ensuring clear and informative output for users.

<h2> Java Skills Demonstrated: </h2>

- Use of ArrayList: The program creates an ArrayList called cars to store a list of vehicles. It demonstrates how to create an ArrayList, add elements to it, access elements using the index, and modify elements.

- Looping: The program uses a for loop to iterate over the ArrayList and print each car. It initializes a loop variable (i) to iterate from 0 to the size of the ArrayList, and then accesses each element using the get() method.

- ArrayList methods: The program uses various ArrayList methods, such as add(), indexOf(), and set(). These methods allow adding elements to the ArrayList, finding the index of an element, and replacing an element at a specific index, respectively.

- Printing output: The program uses System.out.println() to print the report title and the cars in the ArrayList. It demonstrates the basic usage of printing output to the console.

- Enhanced for loop: The program also uses an enhanced for loop (for-each loop) to iterate over the ArrayList and print each car. This type of loop simplifies iterating over collections, such as ArrayLists, by automatically handling the index and providing direct access to each element.
